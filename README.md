# Streamlined ML: from 0 to code

**Streamlined ML: from 0 to code** is a hands-on playground for building machine learning algorithms entirely from scratch. This repo combines DIY implementations of core ML models with an interactive Streamlit demo that lets you test models, visualize results, and explore additional utilities—all without diving deep into the code complexity. Especially for those who wanna see the code of other functions rather than the actual ML class like plot, preprocessing etc.
